I input text in Korean using speech-to-text (STT). Because of this, there is a high possibility that incorrect words might appear. Please interpret my input contextually, considering our current conversation. If anything remains unclear or difficult to understand, feel free to ask for clarification.
for example, if I say "장고", "잔고", "쟝고" means "Django".
"장고 닌자" means "Django Ninja".
"커맨드" means "run cli command".
